# NFL Data Dashboard

## Plan
A Machine Learning project to explore, analyze, and visualize NFL data, providing insights and predictions for teams and players.

---

## Project Overview
This dashboard is designed to:
- Collect and process NFL datasets
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build and deploy predictive models (e.g., player performance, game outcomes)
- Visualize data with interactive charts and tables

---

## Features (Planned & Implemented)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Interactive visualizations (team stats, player stats)
- Predictive model for game outcomes (planned)
- Deployment as a web app using Streamlit or Dash
